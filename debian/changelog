sysklogd (2.2.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix problem with log messages stuck in 1969.  When not using libsyslog,
    or the bundled logger, the syslog() API in the C library is used, which
    may not necessarily set the timestamp.  When sysklogd infers timestamp
    it was offset by the number of years since 1969, i.e., boot_time.
  * Fix problem with repeating kernel messages if syslogd is restarted.
    This introduces a new state file, /var/run/syslogd.cache, which saves
    the last seen/logged sequence id read from `/dev/kmsg`
  * Fix log message time calculation issue on 32-bit systems.
  * Fix remote kernel messages being mapped to uucp instead of user
  * Fix man page syslogd(8), name of PID file (syslog.pid -> syslogd.pid)
